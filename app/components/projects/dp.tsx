            <span className="font-semibold">Context:</span>
            <div>To support the rapid expansion of a startups product portfolio and meet the increasing capital demands, I was tasked with developing a <b>dynamic pricing model</b> tailored to the evolving <b>electronics rental market in Europe</b>. As this market is relatively new, consumer price sensitivity and willingness to pay were largely uncharted. The goal was to design a pricing system that adapts to <b>market conditions</b>, <b>warehouse inventory levels</b>, and other critical factors, ensuring competitive yet profitable pricing strategies in a dynamic environment. This project addressed the need for <b>flexibility and scalability</b> in pricing to drive both customer acquisition and operational efficiency.</div>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">Research:</span>
            <div>The development process began with a thorough review of stakeholder hypotheses and requirements, alongside an analysis of the future performance targets. I led an in-depth <b>price analysis</b> of the current product portfolio, identifying products that were mispriced and presenting actionable insights to the team. Following collaborative discussions around our findings, we received approval to proceed with the development of the dynamic pricing model, ensuring it was aligned with both <b>strategic objectives</b> and operational realities.</div>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">Approach:</span>
            <div>As the team focused on building the dynamic pricing model, I took the lead in selecting an initial representative batch of products to serve as a test sample. We also explored various features that could enhance the model’s accuracy and effectiveness. Once the basic model was developed, we implemented <b>A/B testing</b> over several weeks to assess its impact. The initial results showed a <b>17% revenue increase</b> for the selected products. Encouraged by these promising outcomes, we decided to refine the model and expand its scope to include a broader range of products. This iterative process continued with a <b>four-month testing phase</b> to further optimize the model’s performance.</div>

        <div className="mb-4">
            <span className="font-semibold">Outcome:</span>
            <div>The introduction of the dynamic pricing model resulted in a notable increase in both <b>revenue</b> and <b>stock utilization</b>. Products that were previously overpriced saw improved performance, while underpriced products generated additional revenue for the company. This balanced approach helped <b>optimize the product portfolio</b>, driving both <b>profitability</b> and <b>operational efficiency</b>.</div>
